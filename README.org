* Python

Code for landmark isomap (aka Nystrom approximation), Procrustes analysis, and
various VTK/PIL visualization tools.

To use the library and scripts, add to your /~\/.bashrc/ :
 : export PYTHONPATH=~/code/python/lib:${PYTHONPATH}

The *OpenCV spilltrees*, much faster than the *scipy.spatial kd-trees*, rely on two
patches I sent to OpenCV:
 1. [[https://code.ros.org/trac/opencv/ticket/960][ticket 960, included in SVN revision 4853]]
 2. [[https://code.ros.org/trac/opencv/ticket/1082][ticket 1082, not included yet]]


* Perl

These are various scripts written for my personal usage.

** flickr.pl
Download images from Flickr, with possibility to search by lat-long box and/or
keywords, to choose the size or download the original images (when allowed by
the author).

** pdf2text.pl and pdfdir2text.pl
The first one is a wrapper around the Linux program /pdf2text/. The point is to
get rid of redundant blanks and non-ASCII characters.

The second one is a wrapper around the first one to reproduce an entire
tree of directories, turning the PDF into text files. Very handy when you are
given hundreds of PDF and wish to use /grep/.

** convert_OS_postcodes_to_LatLong.pl
UK postcodes are freely available at
[[https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/opendatadownload/products.html][Code-PointÂ® Open]].
They are in OS grid format, this script turns them in lat-long format.


* Bash

** image_path.sh and magick_morph.sh
The first one turns a list of images in a single line image, the second one
takes a list of images and turn it in a progressive blending animated GIF.
